# auto_trainer

This is app is a fitness trainer for your phone. It was originally my Senior Project, but is something I have wanted since my Junior year of college. I have enjoyed development thus far. I mostly did development for the web or desktop computers in school and I was really interested in making an app for my phone. The idea of making software I could take with me anywhere sounded really fun. Being able to create something helpful for my friends and family sounded rewarding. I used to go the gym everyday, and as I've been getting back into working out I've wanted a way to generate workouts for myself so I don't have to do all that leg work. I looked at about a dozen workout generators on the Google Play Store looking for areas I could add, what I could draw inspiration from and what I hated. I was shocked how blue this ocean was and so I'm excited to make my contribution.
